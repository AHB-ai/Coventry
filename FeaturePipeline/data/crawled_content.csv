This means that children can often live with their prospective adoptive parents from a very young age without having to move between families ACE is the only DDP certified adoption service in the world!

Design: HTML5 UP Privacy policy | Disclaimer | Accessibility | Contact us | Update cookies preferences    Launched on 1 February 2018, ACE has been a regional adoption agency for the local authority areas of Coventry, Herefordshire, Solihull, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire for more than 5 years. Our central purpose is finding the right families for children needing permanent homes through adoption and our overarching aim is to provide a relationship-focussed service for children, adoptive families and others affected by adoption. We achieve this by offering lifelong support, based on up-to-date practices and interventions, supported by modern technology We aim to recognise and value people’s differences and to provide services that are welcoming and respectful. ACE welcomes enquiries about any aspect of adoption from all sections of the community. An established service, ACE has successfully found homes for many children who need families. ACE approves on average 80 adoptive families a year and successfully places in the region of 100-120 children for adoption annually - some will be brothers and sisters who need to stay together. ACE is keen to recruit more families so that children do not have to wait for a family and the best possible ‘family match’ can be found. We believe that there are many advantages to adopting through a regional adoption agency such as ACE. These are: Together we build strong families by promoting adoption as a positive outcome for children who cannot remain in their birth families.

https://www.coventry.gov.uk/a-to-z/service/230/archaeology-,"  Coventry contains an exceptional range of archaeological remains dating from the prehistoric period to the 20th century. Coventry has often suffered from the misconception that much of its history was lost in the Blitz of the Second World War and to the redevelopment that followed, but this is not true. Archaeological work undertaken as part of new developments has shown the extent and significance of surviving archaeological remains in the City, even in intensively developed areas. Archaeological remains are non-renewable and it is therefore essential that they are properly safeguarded - in line with government guidance, the Council's own policies, and recognised best practice - without preventing or discouraging the regeneration, which is essential to Coventry's future. Some archaeological sites in Coventry are protected by law as scheduled monuments, work is not permitted on these sites without the consent of the secretary of state. Archaeological remains can play a positive role in regeneration, providing a context for future development, whilst they can also be an asset to local communities for education, tourism and leisure.

https://www.coventry.gov.uk/a-to-z/service/935/armed-forces-support,"  The Armed Forces Community Covenant was developed and signed in June 2012 by a range of statutory agencies, voluntary and military charities in support of the national Armed Forces Covenant. These agencies have formed a partnership to progress the Covenant across the Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire sub-region. The partnership is chaired and led by Warwickshire County Council and has both strategic and operational (co-ordination) level groups. Coventry City Council, Solihull Borough Council and Warwickshire County Council are represented and participate in both these groups with a variety of organisations from across the sub-region and is known as the CSW Armed Forces Covenant Partnership. The Armed Forces Covenant recognises that the whole nation has a moral obligation to members of the armed forces and their families, and it establishes how they should expect to be treated. The covenant exists to redress the disadvantages that the armed forces community may face in comparison to other citizens, and to recognise sacrifices made. The Armed Forces Covenant is supported by the Community Covenant. The Armed Forces Community Covenant is a voluntary statement of mutual support between a civilian community and its local Armed Forces Community and encourages local communities to support the armed forces community in their area and promote public understanding and awareness. The covenant has established a working group which includes representation from armed forces units, military welfare and veteran support agencies and charities and local authorities. The practical actions of the covenant will be coordinated, managed and monitored by this group. Ideas that support the military community and encourage wider community integration can be developed by anyone or any organisation, for example, sharing experience, knowledge and exchanging examples of good practice and goodwill are welcome. Further information about the CSW Armed Forces Covenant Partnership can be found on the Warwickshire County Council website. "

If you wish to report a dead bird, please call the Customer Service Line at Coventry City Council on 08085 834333 or report dead wild birds online. Bird flu is a virus that affects birds, including wild birds such as geese, swans, birds of prey, pigeons and poultry. As with other viruses, there are lots of different strains of the bird flu virus. The current outbreak seen in the UK can cause severe disease and death in birds. It is spread from bird to bird through contact and through droppings. Wild birds are often more resistant to bird flu than domestic birds and can carry and spread the virus without showing symptoms. Human infections with bird flu are rare and the risk to the general public is very low. However, some strains of the virus, have been associated with human disease. This is why we are encouraging people not to have close contact with dead, sick or injured birds. Of all the reported cases in humans worldwide, almost all have been associated with extremely close contact with infected birds (dead or alive). Close contact includes touching infected birds; contact with droppings; killing or preparing infected birds for cooking; inhalation of feather dust. Bird flu is not transmitted through properly cooked food. Cooked poultry and eggs are safe to eat in areas where outbreaks have occurred. Your health is very important. Please do not approach or touch any dead, ill or injured bird. If you are walking with your dog, keep your dog away from the infected bird. Please do not take an injured bird to the Coventry RSPCA branch or a vet. If you find a dead bird, please report any dead wild birds online or through the Customer Service line on 08085 834333. Someone from the team will attend the park or public place you have identified to remove the bird(s). If the public space is not owned by Coventry City Council, we will forward the information you provided for them to remove the bird. If you find small numbers of dead garden birds at your home you can dispose of them in your household waste bin, or you can bury them. For disposing or burying garden birds you can follow the advice given by the UK Government. You can report small numbers of dead garden birds to Garden Wildlife Health. If you find a dead bird of prey, for example a hawk, or a large number of dead garden birds, for example 5 or more of the same species, you can report this to the Animal and Plant Health Agency. Gardens are really important places for our birds.  Bird flu is predominantly being reported in bird species that are not commonly found in gardens, so the risk to you from wild birds is very small. There is no need to deter birds from coming to your garden. To minimise the risk further, if you see sick or dead birds, do not touch them, their droppings, or any water nearby and clean the birdfeeder and water features when you can. If you see a baby bird (fledgling) in your garden, leave it to its own devices. Its parents are almost certainly nearby and will look after it. If you came into contact with a bird with potential avian flu, please monitor for any flu-like symptoms such as fever and congestion. Please read the NHS website for further details. If your domestic animals (cats or dogs) go outside and could potentially eat sick or dead birds infected with bird flu viruses, there is a small chance they could be infected with bird flu. While it’s unlikely that you would get sick with bird flu through direct contact with your infected pet, it is possible. If your pet is showing signs of illness (such as fever, panting, lethargy) compatible with bird flu virus infection and has been exposed to infected (sick or dead) wild birds/poultry, you should monitor your pet’s health for signs of fever or infection and contact your veterinarian. It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers in Coventry to keep their birds housed and follow strict biosecurity measures. This is regardless of type of bird or size of flock. Biosecurity measures and how to prevent bird flu from spreading on the GOV.UK website. If you keep poultry or a large number of captive birds, we encourage you to notify our Trading Standards Team by emailing tradingstandards@coventry.gov.uk  If the information received from the Animal Plant Health Authority (APHA) changes the team will contact you by email. If you are concerned about the health of your birds, speak to your private vet. If you suspect bird flu, you or your vet must report it immediately to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) even if the signs are mild. Report this immediately by calling APHA on 03000 200 301 How to maintain welfare whilst your birds are housed. Birds of prey or other species trained to fly, such as racing pigeons. "
https://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/158/safeguarding_adults/1066/prevention_of_abuse_and_neglect," Be aware of the risks you face in daily circumstances, when undertaking certain activities, joining particular groups, disclosing personal information or as a result of making any other choices and decisions. You also need to know your rights and the supports and benefits available to help you. You need to develop your ability to keep yourself safe and reduce the likelihood of someone seeing you as someone to exploit or someone whose needs can be ignored or given little importance. You need to know who and where to report concerns quickly about actual or potential mistreatment or neglect so that it can be stopped.  Anyone can be mistreated, exploited or abused at some time in their lives but some people are particularly prone to these things because they are seen as being easy to take advantage of. This may be because they are aged, confused, have learning disabilities, physical impairments, mental health issues, poor mobility or a degree of deafness or blindness.  Similarly, people or groups who are in a minority because of their appearance, behaviour or beliefs, can attract harassment and antisocial behaviour. We don't have to be unscrupulous to mistreat the more vulnerable members of our society. Simple failure to acknowledge people as individuals or to recognise their past and present contribution to family and society is seriously disrespectful and can lead to a breach of human rights, particularly when they are in need of support; whether it be in group or independent accommodation, being treated as a less than whole person can have seriously detrimental consequences for their health, independence and wellbeing. Similarly, failure to recognise care needs is neglectful, albeit unintentional perhaps, and deliberately depriving someone of care identified as a need, is neglect. Many people with care or support needs have family members or intimate partners involved in meeting those needs. Where there is a care support element to the relationship, this can change the balance of power; shifting control and making either party particularly vulnerable to the risk of abuse or neglect by the other. To be able to avoid harm or neglect, you need to: "

They involve discussions, meetings and actions including: You (and/or your advocate) will have the opportunity to have your say at each stage in the process and how you would like to be involved. Your social worker or mental health worker will explain the safeguarding process and ask you what you want to happen as a result of the harm or mistreatment being reported. This will be recorded in the main safeguarding records. The My Safeguarding Experience User Involvement (part 1) may be used to help guide and record conversations. Once the safeguarding process is concluded, telling us about your experience of the process is really valuable to us as it helps to improve our service. There is an online user feedback form, or a downloadable user feedback form to print and post. A Making Safeguarding Personal toolkit for Frontline Staff, Supervisors and Managers has been developed to support the different stages of the safeguarding process, which includes all the tools and explanations of how to use them. In support of Making Safeguarding Personal we also operate a Complex Case and Risk Enablement Panel, recognising that enablement and working with risk are closely linked. A small-scale study was commissioned by Coventry Adult Services Department, undertaken by Coventry University, to evaluate the implementation of Making Safeguarding Personal (MSP).

A Carer's Assessment is a good way to discuss with a professional your needs as a carer, the impact caring may have on you and if there are any aspects of your caring role you are finding hard, need support with or what to come to an end.  We encourage anyone with caring responsibilities to have an assessment. Listed below are some of the things we will look at during your assessment so before you contact us or complete an online self assessment, you might like to think about them. It might help to write things down. Any adult who looks after another adult and may need help to enable them to continue to care can have a carers' assessment under the Care Act 2014. Any adult who may have needs for care and support can have also have their own assessment. The assessment must involve any carers who are providing support and the carer's needs will be considered at the same time. This is called a 'combined carer's assessment'. A carer can also have a separate carer's assessment. Parent carers who look after a disabled child, and young carers can have an assessment under the Children and Families Act. We are in the process of updating our information for parent carers but in the meantime please contact the All Age Disability Service. You can refuse to have an assessment but we may still need to talk to you if we are concerned about your safety and wellbeing. We can still give you information and advice about arranging your own support and accessing activities and groups in your community. If you are offered an assessment but refuse this time, you could still change your mind at a later date. "
https://www.coventry.gov.uk/carersactionplan," Carer's Assessment: This is a way to discuss your needs as a carer, and the impact this may have on you, with a professional. This can be as a combined assessment with the person you look after, or a separate carers assessment. Carer's Allowance: You could be entitled to a weekly Carers Allowance benefit if you care for someone at least 35 hours a week and they receive certain benefits. Access to support specifically for carers, including respite or replacement care (allowing carers to take a break from the caring role or ensuring the individual receives care in event of an emergency), support groups, information and advice, training and other health and wellbeing support (for example, counselling or group support sessions). The individual you are supporting is also entitled to a social care assessment to understand their needs and possible support options. Further information on carers assessments, support and how to access this are available via the Council website. You can also complete a Carer’s Assessment for yourself on our website.

The action plan is a working document, and we aim to continue to work with local carers and third sector organisations to shape the priorities and actions moving forward. Download and print the Carers' Action Plan. Carers can be of anyone of any age, ethnicity, or background, with most of us likely to be affected by or have caring responsibilities at some stage in our lives. While this role can be immensely rewarding, it can also significantly impact the carer's life, affecting their own health, wellbeing, and opportunities. The role of a carer might not be immediately apparent, often perceived simply as assisting a loved one. This support can take various forms, such as practical tasks, personal care, emotional support, advocacy, or financial management. Though each carer's experience is unique, their contribution is invaluable, and the person they care for would struggle without their support. If you are a carer, you may be entitled to a range of support and benefits to assist both you and the person you care for. This includes: The Carers' Action Plan 2024-26 has been developed following analysis of the biennial Survey of Adult Carers in England 2021/22, a local ‘Let’s Talk’ Coventry Carers' Survey undertaken in 2023 and using national information and data sets.

Additional resources are available on our carers’ information pages. For specific support services, you can connect with the Carers Trust Heart of England, an organisation commissioned by the Council to provide assistance without any charge to the carer. We encourage all carers and those who suspect they may be carers to take advantage of the resources and support available. Together, we can make a positive and lasting impact on the lives of carers in our community. "
https://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/76/carers/923/young_carers,"  Young carers are young people who help care for a family member who is disabled, physically or mentally ill, has a long term serious illness or has a substance misuse problem. This is a role that many young people are happy and proud to do. However, inappropriate or excessive levels of caring can put their education, training or health at risk, and may prevent them from enjoying their childhood. A young carer is a child or young person under 18 and a young adult carer is aged 18 - 25. Some young carers may be susceptible to poor outcomes because they frequently miss out on normal childhood experiences and lack the social networks experienced by their friends without caring roles. Evidence shows that 30% of Young Carers experience problems at school with attendance, attainment and social development, rising to 40% where they care within a family affected by substance misuse. In addition, there may be physical problems such as excessive tiredness or injury from lifting and assisting others, and emotional and mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression and a sense of isolation. Young adult carers often do not have the same opportunities as other young people to continue their education, go to university, and go to work. Often there will be more than one young carer in the family and the caring role is likely to extend beyond looking after the cared for person and may include taking siblings to school and looking after their social and emotional, as well as practical needs.

Since vaccines were introduced in the UK, diseases like smallpox, polio and tetanus are rarely seen. However, if people stop having vaccines, infectious diseases may quickly spread again. All vaccines are thoroughly tested to make sure they will not harm you or your child. In England, most vaccinations are offered free on the NHS. To protect children as early as possible many vaccines are offered to babies and toddlers before they start school. Vaccinations are usually given by practice nurses at your GP practice. Practice nurses are specially trained to give advice and offer vaccines. Older children are offered some vaccinations in school For more information about the local Coventry service in schools please visit the CWPT School Aged Immunisation and Vaccination Service website The NHS has produced a guide to help you understand the vaccines offered in the UK and when to have them. It also explains how they work and why they're safe and important. Read the NHS vaccination guidance. If you are unsure if you or your child has had all the recommended vaccinations in England – check with your GP practice. It is never too late to catch-up on the vaccinations recommended. We have produced information leaflets that outline the current vaccine schedule, and these are available in a number of commonly spoken languages including Arabic, Bengali, Kurdish, Polish and Tigrinya.  The resources can be downloaded. Speak to your practice nurse, GP or your Health Visitor if you're worried about you or your child having a vaccine.  You can text your Health Visitor on CHAT Health: 07507 329114 or via Facebook. The issue of pork ingredients in some vaccines is a concern for some people and communities.  Read about how and why pork gelatine is used in vaccines.

If you wish to report a dead bird, please call the Customer Service Line at Coventry City Council on 08085 834333 or report dead wild birds online. Bird flu is a virus that affects birds, including wild birds such as geese, swans, birds of prey, pigeons and poultry. As with other viruses, there are lots of different strains of the bird flu virus. The current outbreak seen in the UK can cause severe disease and death in birds. It is spread from bird to bird through contact and through droppings. Wild birds are often more resistant to bird flu than domestic birds and can carry and spread the virus without showing symptoms. Human infections with bird flu are rare and the risk to the general public is very low. However, some strains of the virus, have been associated with human disease. This is why we are encouraging people not to have close contact with dead, sick or injured birds. Of all the reported cases in humans worldwide, almost all have been associated with extremely close contact with infected birds (dead or alive). Close contact includes touching infected birds; contact with droppings; killing or preparing infected birds for cooking; inhalation of feather dust. Bird flu is not transmitted through properly cooked food. Cooked poultry and eggs are safe to eat in areas where outbreaks have occurred. Your health is very important. Please do not approach or touch any dead, ill or injured bird. If you are walking with your dog, keep your dog away from the infected bird. Please do not take an injured bird to the Coventry RSPCA branch or a vet. If you find a dead bird, please report any dead wild birds online or through the Customer Service line on 08085 834333. Someone from the team will attend the park or public place you have identified to remove the bird(s). If the public space is not owned by Coventry City Council, we will forward the information you provided for them to remove the bird. If you find small numbers of dead garden birds at your home you can dispose of them in your household waste bin, or you can bury them. For disposing or burying garden birds you can follow the advice given by the UK Government. You can report small numbers of dead garden birds to Garden Wildlife Health. If you find a dead bird of prey, for example a hawk, or a large number of dead garden birds, for example 5 or more of the same species, you can report this to the Animal and Plant Health Agency. Gardens are really important places for our birds.  Bird flu is predominantly being reported in bird species that are not commonly found in gardens, so the risk to you from wild birds is very small. There is no need to deter birds from coming to your garden. To minimise the risk further, if you see sick or dead birds, do not touch them, their droppings, or any water nearby and clean the birdfeeder and water features when you can. If you see a baby bird (fledgling) in your garden, leave it to its own devices. Its parents are almost certainly nearby and will look after it. If you came into contact with a bird with potential avian flu, please monitor for any flu-like symptoms such as fever and congestion. Please read the NHS website for further details. If your domestic animals (cats or dogs) go outside and could potentially eat sick or dead birds infected with bird flu viruses, there is a small chance they could be infected with bird flu. While it’s unlikely that you would get sick with bird flu through direct contact with your infected pet, it is possible. If your pet is showing signs of illness (such as fever, panting, lethargy) compatible with bird flu virus infection and has been exposed to infected (sick or dead) wild birds/poultry, you should monitor your pet’s health for signs of fever or infection and contact your veterinarian. It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers in Coventry to keep their birds housed and follow strict biosecurity measures. This is regardless of type of bird or size of flock. Biosecurity measures and how to prevent bird flu from spreading on the GOV.UK website. If you keep poultry or a large number of captive birds, we encourage you to notify our Trading Standards Team by emailing tradingstandards@coventry.gov.uk  If the information received from the Animal Plant Health Authority (APHA) changes the team will contact you by email. If you are concerned about the health of your birds, speak to your private vet. If you suspect bird flu, you or your vet must report it immediately to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) even if the signs are mild. Report this immediately by calling APHA on 03000 200 301 How to maintain welfare whilst your birds are housed. Birds of prey or other species trained to fly, such as racing pigeons. "

https://www.coventry.gov.uk/animals-pests/adopting-dog,"  Our Dog Enforcement Officers often get asked what happens to the stray dogs we find in Coventry that do not get claimed by their owners. So, we thought we’d shine a spotlight on the charity, Birmingham Dogs Home with whom we’ve worked closely for many years, to help rehome thousands of Coventry’s unwanted pets. When a stray dog is collected in Coventry, our Dog Wardens work hard to try and find the owner. However, some owners unfortunately never come forward to collect their dog. These unclaimed dogs are transferred to Birmingham Dogs Home, which, after 7 days can legally rehome the dog to a new family. During their time at the dogs' home, the stray dogs are given the same loving care and attention as the many other abandoned and relinquished dogs brought into Birmingham Dogs' Home, whose kennels are situated in the rural surroundings of Catherine De Barnes, Solihull. It’s here where dogs have the use of the top facilities, such as modern kennels staffed 24 hours a day, and access to exercise and enrichment areas. When a stray dog is transferred here from Coventry, staff at the dogs' home set to work straight away to help make the dogs feel at home. As with many stray dogs, we often know nothing of the dog’s history or temperament. Assessments take place for each dog which includes monitoring the dog’s behaviour and giving them a vaccination and a health check with their on-site vet. Staff also work on socialising and help with any training needs each dog requires. All of this helps staff to understand each individual dog’s needs which ultimately leads to them being rehomed to the perfect family. If you’re considering buying a dog, it’s well worth planning a visit to Birmingham Dogs' Home, which currently has over 180 dogs of different breeds, sizes and ages all looking for loving new homes! Visit the Birmingham Dogs' Home website for further information and to see some of the dogs currently up for adoption.  "
https://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/64/animals_and_pests/770/dangerous_dogs,"  All dog owners must keep their dog under control at all times. A dog that shows aggression towards someone may be considered dangerous even if it has not bitten anyone. If a person has reasonable belief that the dog will bite, court action may be taken against the owner under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 by the Police. When a dog is 'dangerously out of control in a public place' but has not injured anyone, the penalty is up to six months in prison or a fine, or both. If a dog has injured someone the penalty is increased, to a maximum of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. We would strongly recommend that dog owners make sure their gardens are secure, so that dogs are unable to get out and make anyone feel threatened. All dangerous dogs' enquiries are dealt with by the Police in Coventry. Latest Government information regarding the ban on XL Bully Dogs. "
https://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/64/animals_and_pests/771/microchipping_of_dogs," It is a legal requirement for dogs in England to be microchipped and for the details on the microchip to remain up-to-date. Further information about The Microchipping of Dogs (England) Regulations 2015 requirement. Having your dog microchipped, is one of the best ways to increase your pet's chances of getting home should they become lost. Unlike dog collars and tags, which can fall off or be removed, microchipping is a permanent form of identifying your dog. One of the first things our Dog Wardens will check for when they find a stray dog, is a microchip! Meaning within minutes we could be contacting you to let you know we have found your dog. A microchip about the size of a grain of rice is inserted under your dog's loose skin on the back of the neck by a trained professional. Each microchip has a unique number attached to it. If you are having your dog microchipped by your vet or other trained professional, they will fill in a form with you, taking note of your contact details and information about your dog. The details you give will be your name, address, telephone number and email address, plus details about your dog, such as the dog's breed, date of birth, gender and colour. The microchip implanter will then send off the paperwork and complete the registration, however, some implanters give the remaining paperwork to you to post yourself to complete the registration. Please make sure you complete the registration. Without the chip being fully registered, no details of the owner will be displayed when the microchip is scanned. This makes the whole procedure worthless unless you make sure the chip is registered! You'll also be able to keep a copy of the paperwork for your records. Keep this safe for future reference, you'll need it if you want to update the details on the microchip in future, or to pass on to the new owner if you rehome your dog. Within 5-10 days of the paperwork being sent off, your dog's microchip will be live on the national database. If your dog ever goes missing, they usually end up with a vet or a dog warden, who is able to scan your dog's microchip and retrieve the information from the database, then contact you! It is a legal requirement to do this, but here are some of the practical reasons why it is also important to keep your details up to date; When our dog wardens collect a stray dog, one of the first things they do is scan the dog for a microchip, if the details are not up to date, it causes problems and delays in us getting your dog reunited with you. Sometimes mobile numbers have been changed and are no longer in use. Sometimes landlines are listed but the owner has since moved house. This is why it's important to keep telephone numbers up to date, we advise you to list 2 or 3 alternative telephone numbers on your dog's microchip so that we can get through to you, or another family member who can let you know we have your dog. If we can't get through to you on the telephone, or after no response from leaving a voicemail or sending a text to you, our dog wardens will post a notice to the address listed against the microchip to inform you that we have your dog. This is usually a hand-delivered notice if the registered owner lives in Coventry. However, if you move house and don't update your dog's microchip with your new address, this letter will be sent to your old address, and likely not opened and sent back to us! We will also try to email you if there is an email address included on the microchip database, however, if the email address is no longer in use, such as when people list work email addresses and then change jobs, it usually bounces back to us. Once we have tried all the above options, and we still haven't been able to make contact with you, all we can do is post a picture of your dog on our Facebook page, and hope that you see it and call us! All this stress for you and your pet, could all be avoided if you keep your dog's microchip up to date, and we could call you straight away and have you reunited with your dog within the hour! If you have your dog's microchip paperwork - Check the paperwork to find your dog's microchip number and the name of the database company your dog is microchipped with (usually Petlog, or Petrac). Visit the chip company's website or call them to update the details on the microchip. There is usually a fee of between £10-£15 to update the details, once you have paid the fee, some companies allow you to change the details multiple times in future without a further payment being required. If you do not have your dog's microchip paperwork - Take your dog to a vet to be scanned to find out what your dog's microchip number is and which microchip company they are registered with. The vet cannot make any changes for you, they can only scan the dog. You'll need to contact the microchip company yourself to make any changes and provide proof that you are the owner on the microchip. If you have purchased a puppy from a breeder and need to update the microchip details - A good breeder will supply you with a pack containing all of your new puppy's important paperwork and should give you advice regarding changing the details over from them to you. Make sure you do this as soon as you get home with your new puppy! Puppies can be microchipped after they reach 8 weeks old unless a vet has certified that they are too small. In which case, speak to your vet when you have your puppy registered within a month. If you are rehoming your dog to somebody else -  It is also your responsibility to make sure the new owner changes the ownership on the microchip. When they do this, you will also be notified by the microchip company. If you have bought a dog to the UK from abroad -  Be aware, if a dog is microchipped outside the UK and the details held are on a European database not within the UK, then we cannot always access these databases to obtain the owner's details. To find out if your dog's chip is traceable in the UK, take your dog to a vet to be scanned. The vet can then attempt to access the database to find the details held on the microchip. If they cannot trace the chip, you could find out which company the chip is registered with and speak to them for further advice. If they are unable to transfer the details over to a database traceable in the UK, you may need to get further advice from the vet about having another chip implanted. This is not usually something we recommend, only in special circumstances should a dog be implanted with two microchips.  As Dog Wardens, it's our job to keep stray dogs off the street and reunite them with their owners. We also promote and educate owners on responsible dog ownership. Getting your dog microchipped should be a top priority, along with registering your dog at the vet, getting your dog routinely vaccinated and treating your dog regularly for worms and fleas. We've put together further information below about the importance of having your dog microchipped, plus some tips and advice regarding keeping the details up-to-date on your dog's microchip and how this helps us reunite you with your lost dog quickly. Please note, the Council do not currently offer a service for microchipping dogs, we recommend contacting a vet to get your dog booked in for this. If your dog comes into our kennels and does not meet The Microchipping of Dogs (England) Regulations 2015 requirements, the keeper of the dog will be issued with a Notice upon collection of the dog. This Notice will inform the Keeper of the dog that they have 21 days from the date of the Notice being issued, to complete the recommended actions to meet the requirements. Failure to comply with the Notice within the set time will result in prosecution proceedings being initiated by Coventry City Council which could see the Keeper being issued a £500.00 fine, plus court costs.

If there is no immediate risk to life, put your pets in a carrier or on a leash, and collect your grab bag. If you have time, write EVACUATED over your Pet Alert Sticker. Never leave your pets at home unless you absolutely can’t help it! If you do have to, bring them indoors and shut them in an upstairs room with 5-7 days of dry food and water. Responders may be overwhelmed for several days before they can even think about looking for pets, and the priority will always be to save human life. Should a large number of people be evacuated, the council will open a rest centre. All rest centres in this area accept pets, but you may have to leave your animals in their carriers or on a lead. You will also be responsible for their welfare and cleaning up after them. If the evacuation lasts longer than a day, you’ll be moved into a hotel. We’ll always try and find one that takes pets, but this isn’t always possible. This is where your friends and relatives come in! Otherwise, we hold a list of animal boarding facilities in the nearby area. Fires, chemical spills, and any number of other emergencies might require you and your animals to have to evacuate your house. Make sure you (and they) are prepared.

It’s now a legal requirement to microchip your dogs, but it’s also beneficial for cats and rabbits.  In an emergency, strange sights, sounds and smells can cause your pet to become disoriented and lost. A microchip is the single best way to ensure you are reunited. If there are people outside your immediate area you could stay with, or who could look after your pets, get in contact prior to an incident. If you have a neighbour who you trust with a house key, consider talking to them about collecting your pets if you are out of the house when an evacuation order is issued.  Take a mobile phone number so you can remind them. Always keep your pets vaccinations up to date. Not only does not doing so expose them to all sorts of biological hazards, it means the majority of animal boarding facilities wont accept them. Designed by  Core Design Communications Ltd "

The strategy will make Coventry a leading city of culture in modern Britain and help bring about future economic success and improved quality of life for residents. It has been funded by the City Council and Arts Council England with support from both the University of Warwick and Coventry University and is based on an extensive consultation process. The Strategy builds on the heritage and culture of the city and introduces five key goals for cultural growth and seven big ideas for transforming the cultural life of the city. The initial five goals are: A new partnership approach to cultural growth will ensure access and sustainable funding for a wide range of cultural organisations, activities and events across the city. This partnership brings together the City Council, communities, the universities, local businesses and charities, and the professional and amateur cultural sectors. All children and young people have an entitlement to the arts and digital creativity in schools and in their community which is not limited by family income, location or age.
There are opportunities for all generations to learn from and develop through the arts and there will be an emphasis on lifelong learning and talent being recognised. Communities and individuals will be empowered to celebrate and share their heritage, culture, abilities and identity and take part in the cultural life of the city.
Diversity is one of Coventry's strengths and resources and Coventry is a national centre of excellence for diversity in the arts and creative industries. Arts and culture are core to the health and wellbeing of the city, with events helping to combat isolation and mental health problems in vulnerable communities.
Culture makes a major contribution to encouraging healthy lifestyles and physical activity. Coventry is a culturally vibrant, attractive and prosperous city that enriches the lives and environment for all residents.
The city is a major tourist destination for the West Midlands and successfully attracts new businesses and investment, particularly in high- tech creative industries, talent development and cultural production. Arts and culture promote and support behavioural and environmental changes to address the climate crisis and encourage green activism. Arts and culture model circular economy practices and principles in production and
programming that bring fun, interactive and entertaining activities to celebrate and sustain the city’s green and other heritage sites.

https://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/51/welcome_to_coventry/548/newly_arrived_communities/3,"  The Syrian Vulnerable People's Resettlement Scheme was announced by the Home Secretary on 29 January 2014. It is designed to provide assistance to Syrians who have fled to neighbouring countries as a result of the current crisis and who are particularly vulnerable. Coventry joined the scheme in July 2014, and since then we have become one of the leading cities in the UK for the resettlement of refugees. In October 2016 Coventry joined the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme. This scheme focuses on the resettlement of vulnerable children and their immediate families from the Middle East and North Africa. This scheme is run in the same way as the Syrian VPR scheme. In March 2021, the VPRS and VCRS have been replaced by the UKRS. The UK Resettlement Scheme has a geographical focus beyond the Middle East and North Africa region. As of October 2022,  over 1000 refugees have been welcomed into the city under these schemes. We will continue to work closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to target those in greatest need of assistance, including people requiring urgent medical treatment, survivors of violence and torture, and women and children at risk. UNHCR is uniquely placed to identify those living in formal refugee camps, informal settlements and host communities who would benefit most from resettlement to the UK. Coventry City Council leads a partnership of organisations throughout the city, in order to deliver this programme. Our key partners are Coventry Citizens Advice, Coventry Refugee and Migrant Centre, St Francis of Assisi Church (Radford), FWT - a centre for women and Positive Youth Foundation. The UK Home Office is responsible for setting the criteria under which people are resettled into the UK and oversees the schemes. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) submits potential cases for the Home Office to consider. Once a case has passed this initial stage, the International Organisation for Migration (IoM) will conduct a full medical examination. Case files including this information are then sent to participating local authorities for consideration on the grounds of medical needs, availability of accommodation, and the potential impact on local services. The City Council has committed to resettling 125 people per year. The schemes were due to end in 2020, however, this is no longer the case. We are still currently accepting clients due to the delays the pandemic has caused, however, going forward the scheme will change. On 17 June 2019, the Home Secretary announced that the current format of the UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS) would be changing and from 2020 it would be consolidating the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme, the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme and the Gateway Protection Programme under the umbrella of the UKRS. The purpose of this is to resettle up to 5,000 of the world's most vulnerable refugees in the UK within the first year of the scheme; refugees who would have previously been resettled through the flagship Vulnerable Person's Resettlement Scheme. Funding for resettlement schemes is provided by the Home Office. Home Office funding is used to secure private rented accommodation for the first year. We have not used the City Council's existing housing stock, meaning that social housing waiting lists have not been affected. Coventry Schools will receive a grant for each child attending under the resettlement schemes. This is to aid their education and integration into the UK's school system, whilst reducing the impact on school budgets. "

Coventry City Council has produced detailed guidance about the EU Settlement Scheme for EEA nationals, employers and landlords as well as the Local Authority. This has BrowseAloud functionality, which translates into various languages. The application deadline for the EU Settlement Scheme was 30 June 2021, which has now passed. Beyond this date, for now, eligible nationals will be able to submit late applications to the EU Settlement Scheme providing there is a ‘reasonable excuse’.

The project addresses local, social and economic inequalities that hinder the way young people and adults from migrant communities interact and become part of the local area. The specialist partnership intends to bridge service gaps, provide mentoring, coaching and holistic interventions to support client progression and integration. It is aimed at non-EU and EEA nationals living in Coventry. The city-wide partnership between Coventry City Council, the Job Shop, St Francis Church of Assisi, ACH, Coventry University and Positive Youth Foundation is part-funded by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). The scheme will help improve language skills and enable new communities to learn and feel a part of the life of the city; as well as boost employment opportunities. A key component of MyCoventry is the ‘Integrass’ Assessment Toolkit which will produce a Personalised Integration Plan for each client, based on an individual’s specific needs and barriers. Clients will complete the short assessment with a member of staff, and again at a later date to monitor progress. This will inform personalised pathways across the project, facilitating language learning, employment support, civic orientation and meaningful contact with the host society for clients. Each partner will have designated mentors who will meet regularly with clients to discuss their progress and signpost them to services across the city.

We also assist with accessing other support agencies using the services of a translator if required. We endeavour to assist any young person we are supporting who wishes to trace their families overseas; we do this in partnership with the Red Cross. We also assist young people we are supporting in seeking emotional support caused by severe trauma and will put them in touch with the relevant help required. Before young people are 18 years we contact the appropriate agencies to try and ensure a smooth transfer. Once young people have reached the age of 18 years support is available from the Local Authority via The Through Care team up until the age of 25 years. Through Care Migrant Help
